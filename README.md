I developed a Mobile Shop Management System using C++ to streamline the operations of a mobile phone shop. This system includes functionalities for employee management, sales tracking, stock management, and customer reviews. It allows users to efficiently add, update, and delete products, view customer information, and process sales transactions. The goal of this project was to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of managing a mobile shop, providing a comprehensive solution for day-to-day business operations.
